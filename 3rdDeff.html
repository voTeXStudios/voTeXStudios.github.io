				We have added new commands and new aspects to our shell. We strived hard to get our job done. We had some troubles getting to learn some concepts of the shell
				But we helped each other as a group to pull up.
				Some of the functionalities we added involves pipes and redirecting a stream.

			<p class="content1">Its a shell game we designed. Its a game that runs on a loop. It involves ascii art.
				We always had this idea to have our shell not only have the basic functionalities but also games which
				can make it much more attractive to the user. When we launch our program, it clears out the terminal for the game to be played.
