            VolteX Studios was formed in 2019. Since that day, as a group we had lots
of ups and downs. Our last project, Optical character recognition was well
polished project. And to carry on the legacy of this group, we will embark
upon another journey which again requires as much hard work if not more.
YUP! More frustration and rants, but of course with an output.
<br><br>
The project we decided to work on is to create a Shell, which will be
eventually called as Vol-Tex-Sh. We come across different kind of shells ev-
ery time in our life specially being engineers. And as a group, it always has
fascinated us how shells actually work.
<br><br>
In the end we want our shell to be like bash. We would like to focus more
on the interactive part of the shell more than the scripting-oriented aspect of
it. We would like to have our own small-interpreted language. Thatâ€™s what
we are striving to emulate.
<br><br>
Before diving into the details of our progress. Here is a quick introduction
from the team and what they have to say about the new journey we have
embarked upon.
