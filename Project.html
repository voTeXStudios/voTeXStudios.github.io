            <h2 class="header1"> About The Project </h2>
            <p class="content1">The latest endevour we embarked upon is a shell. After lot of meetings and transmission of ideas among us,
                we decided to go for a multi utitlity shell with basic builtin commands.

            <h2 class="header1"> What is a Shell?</h2>
            <p class="content1">A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input
                from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes
                executing, it displays that program’s output.<br><br>
                Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs,
                and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different
                flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of
                recognized commands and functions.<br><br>
                The shell is an interactive interface that allows users to execute other
                commands and utilities in Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems.
                When you login to the operating system, the standard shell is displayed and
                allows you to perform common operations such as copy files or restart the
                system.

            <h3 class="header1">Working?</h3>
            <p class="content1">
                Let’s look at a shell from the top down. A shell does three main things in
                its lifetime.
                <br>
                <ul class="content1">
                    <li>Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its
                        configuration files. These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.</li>
                    <li>Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could
                        be interactive, or a file) and executes them.</li>
                    <li>Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any
                        shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="HeadingBox">
            <h4 class="header1">User Interface</h4>
            <p class="content1">
                Regarding the UI of the shell, we will implement a basic, simple user interface
                that is appealing to the user. The UI will have a theme, with different colors
                that serve different purposes. For this end, the GTK library will be used in
                order to implement the UI.
