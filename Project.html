            <p class="content1">The latest endevour we embarked upon is a shell. After lot of meetings and transmission of ideas among us,
                we decided to go for a multi utitlity shell with basic builtin commands.

            <h2 class="header1"> What is a Shell?</h2>
            <p class="content1">A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input
                from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program finishes
                executing, it displays that program’s output.<br><br>
                Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs,
                and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different
                flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of
                recognized commands and functions.<br><br>
                The shell is an interactive interface that allows users to execute other
                commands and utilities in Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems.
                When you login to the operating system, the standard shell is displayed and
                allows you to perform common operations such as copy files or restart the
                system.

            <h3 class="header1">How does it work?</h3>
            <p class="content1">
                Let’s look at a shell from the top down. A shell does three main things in
                its lifetime.
                <br>
                <ul class="content1">
                    <li>Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its
                        configuration files. These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.</li>
                    <li>Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could
                        be interactive, or a file) and executes them.</li>
                    <li>Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any
                        shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4 class="header1">Single Player Mode</h4>
            <p class="content1">There is a single player version in our game. The player will discover the 
                same map, but now the player has two types of guns, the portal gun and the bot shooting gun, you
                can switch between the two using Right Shift.
