			<h2 class="header1">Overview</h2>
			<p class="content1">This time around we have implemented few commands which are not builtins.
				We also worked with regex library from C libraries for the first time to implement the grep command, 
				which we know is important for any shell. We also progressed in terms of autocompletion. 
				We also implemented a open scientific calculator for our shell.

				<br><br>

				 
				Presenting the highlights of our work:-
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="Box1">
			<h2 class="header1">Calc</h2>
			<img src="Calc.png" class="img1">
			<p class="content1">This function can be used to open up a scientific calculator with up to 22 math
				operations. This function can be very useful to make quick mathematical calcu-
				lations. It takes in input from 0 to 22. User has to input on stdin. The result is
				printed out on the shell. They way we have implemented the command is goes
				on in and infinite loop until user inputs 0.

				<br><br>

				As you can see, you can perform endless number of calculations before you
				choose to exit the function.

			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="Box2">
			<h2 class="header1">Alias</h2>
			<img src="Alias.png" class="img2">
			<p class="content1">
				A function that helps the user interact with our shell in an easier way, this func-
				tion is used to create an "alias" for any one if the existing commands. This can
				be used to streamline the process of using big command names by shortening
				them to a more comfortable command name.
				<br><br>
				The way it has been implemented is that our function tries to duplicate the
				3rd argument into the 2nd argument.

		<div class="Box1">
			<h2 class="header1">grep</h2>
			<img src="grep.png" class="img1">
			<p class="content1">
				Grep basically is a command that tries to match the pattern which could be a
regular expression or a sub-string to a file. It could be multiple files. I use regex
to do grep.
<br><br>
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pat-
tern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find"
or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a tech-
nique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.
<br><br>
For this we have used the regex library. The implementation and usage of the
regex library was kinda difficult to understand with all the flags. But basically
we have implemented two attributes for grep, -i and -E. -i is a ignore case flag
which does not recognise Extended regular expression. -E is the attribute to
use Extended regular expressions.
<br><br>
As you can see, this code is for compiling the pattern, either a regular expres-
sion or a substring. It uses regcomp function from the library which basically
a buffer as the first argument and stores the matched info. After it has the
compiled pattern, it goes through the lines of the file and matches the string.

			<h2 class="header1">What's next?</h2>
			<p class="content1">
				For the next defence we are gonna implement piping and fd redirection. We
realise by this defence, it should have been done. But because of internal prob-
lems in the group, we lagged behind. Nevertheless, we will strive to finish our
job. Along with this we are gonna implement the history of the shell. Few more
commands. And the regex will be implemented for every command line. We
will be introducing the GUI. We feel we have the basics
ready for a shell. We just need to wrap up few things.
At the end, we would like to say that we are glad with whatever progress
we have made so far considering the problems we were facing with one of our
teammates.
